# PROJECT Z:ULU
**PROJECT Z:ULU**, or in better terms **PROJECT ZOMBOID: Unturned Loath Unturnt**, is a modpack/server that is meant to be a ultrahardcore/immersive Project Zomboid experience. The name is reference to Unturned, another zombie survival yet Rust-like game, and also a reference to an Unturned modpack my friend made. This modpack was originally "Get Stoned, Drive Cars, Shoot Guns" which was a modpack focused around; well; getting high, driving sick as hell cars, and shooting hoards with guns.

This modpack is meant to be an immersive experience taking a normally chill game or abhorently hard game in the right scenario, to a game thats like a long-con version of "Trouble in Terrorist Town" where you can't trust anyone, while still retaining the survival aspect and suprisingly, team building and immersion.

## GIST
### **Immerse into New Flesh**
When creating a character, you must name it a reasonable name. Use proper capitalization in the name, use the randomized character name you get in the character creator for the best result. You can name them something like "Gordon Freeman" or "Patton Oswalt" or whatever sort of name you want. Just become the character you play as, but be warned...

### **Your Flesh is not the Same Flesh**
...upon death, you must create a character that is different to the character you last played (stats, profession, and name). You could return to where you died but maybe that's not the greatest idea. Also, *DO NOT CHEESE MECHANICS** like zombie infections, or writing your stats in a journal only to kill yourself to get a character with different stats, or generally just using immersion-breaking tactics to "make the game easier" or to completely get rid of any difficult aspect of the game.

### **Your Radio isn't Online**
You must *NOT* communicate with others about shenanegains that happened in the server outside of the server (ie. through Discord). If you come across someone in game, that's the only contact you are going to get with them. Set up radio lines if you need long-distance communication. You are allowed to stream this online, but do not watch other peoples streams as that will break immersion and provide unfair advantages. If you plan to join the server do not watch anyone's streams.

### **Kill if Needed, Trust No One**
When push comes to shove -- stomp. Kill others in your way: spare them if you want, befriend them if you need, kill them if you must. Don't be afraid to hold a man at gunpoint and have him drop his gear. If you get bit, decieve until you find a cure; lest they find out and kill you instead.

### **Why not Write a Little?**
I urge you to write things down in notebooks or jot down things on maps or pieces of paper. Leave little bits of information out for other survivors to learn from, or to be decieved by. Just journal your travels and experiences as if you were the character you are playing as, let people who kill you learn about the character you are.
